^The network was trained on this set with translation, rotation, and scale augmentations. At the end, around 99% accuracy was obtained. 

Below is the visual aid for the presentation we presented.

At the symposium, users were invited up to a running notebook to test out their own handwritten numbers. All handwriting by volunteers was correctly recognized. 

# Usage

The code runs in a Juptyer Notebook.
Needs python 3.6.x
